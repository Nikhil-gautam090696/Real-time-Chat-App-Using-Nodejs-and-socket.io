**Dependencies**

In this project I've used following dependencies
- socket.io (Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.)
- nodemon (nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.)
- express.js ( Express js is a back end web application framework for Node.js)
